   Array                Collection

1. Fixed in size       1. Collection is growable in nature
                          Size of the collection can be increased
                          or decreased at the runtime.

2. NO built-in         2. Collection has built-in methods
   method support         to perform basic and advanced operations
                          on the group of data.   
                          
3. Don't have any      3. Every collection is built by using
   underlying DS          at least one DS
   
  
  
 * Collection is a group of references which is represented as One unit.
 
 * Collection are of 3 types
   
   1. List
   2. Set
   3. Queue
   
   
   List type of Collection
   
   * List can store duplicates.
   * List has index.
   * List support multiple null values.
   * List preserve insertion order.
   
   
   ArrayList
   
   * ArrayList can store duplicates.
   * ArrayList has index.
   * ArrayList support multiple null values.
   * ArrayList preserve insertion order.
   
   * Resizable array is the underlying Data Structure of ArrayList.
   
   Constructors of ArrayList
   
   ArrayList()
   Constructs an empty list with an initial capacity of ten.
   
   ArrayList(Collection c)
   Constructs a list containing the elements 
   of the specified collection.
   
   ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
   Constructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity.
   
   Methods of ArrayList
   
   *
   *
   ..
   
   * ArrayList implementation is not synchronized. 
   * ArrayList is NOT THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an ArrayList concurrently, 
     and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, 
     it will impact on other threads.

  Vector
   
   * Vector can store duplicates.
   * Vector has index.
   * Vector support multiple null values.
   * Vector preserve insertion order.
   
   * Resizable array is the underlying Data Structure of Vector.
   
   * The increase of capacity can be controlled by the programmer
     by specifying the capacityIncrement in the constructor.
     
   Constructors of Vector 
     
   Vector()
   Constructs an empty vector so that its internal 
   data array has size 10 and its standard 
   capacity increment is zero.
   
   Vector(Collection c)
   Constructs a vector containing the elements 
   of the specified collection.
  
   Vector(int initialCapacity)
   Constructs an empty vector with the specified 
   initial capacity and with its capacity increment 
   equal to zero.
   
   Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)
   Constructs an empty vector with the specified initial 
   capacity and capacity increment.
   
   * Vector implementation is synchronized. 
   * Vector is THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an Vector concurrently, 
     and at least one of the threads modifies the Vector structurally, 
     it will NOT impact on other threads.
